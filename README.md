2. In the terminal, `cd` to the repository directory and run

```bash
npm i
```

3. Then start the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

4. You can then navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser of choice

## Future Development
* Beautification of the app -- Specifically a better table with proper headings and lines
* Multiple Ordering options
* Filter by State -- All of the example Employees are based in the US, so a State filter would be a handy Use Case
